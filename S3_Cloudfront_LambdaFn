Providing password-based access to a private S3 bucket with Lambda and CloudFront

i have some website and i have to host from my s3 bucket, but the problem is i have to make public my bucket so i think its not a good way to public your bcuket
so i used instead of se cloudfront service with using lambda function for password protection on that , 
i just login using my user and password to the website , its a static website basically if i use dynamic website it will have database .

so here i have started 

first step is to create bucket .
now add file or code to the bucket 

now go to lambda function 
function name <> >> change default execution role <create role > role name > policy tamplete choose <Basic Lambda@Edge permissions (for CloudFront trigger)>
create function > copy paste code in that add user password  and click on deploy >> action >publish new version >> copy arn 

now go to cloud watch paste that arn in > Function associations > Viewer request > lambda@edge > paste arn in that box.
in cloudwatch 
Origin domain<choose s3 bucket name>
Origin access <Legacy access identities>

Yes, update the bucket policy
Default root object - optional <index.html>
 
 
now copy Distribution domain name and paste it to google
